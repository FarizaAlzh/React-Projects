# Sample React Starter (Favorites + Firebase)

Quick starter demonstrating:

- Fullscreen responsive layout
- Header / Footer / Outlet
- Routing with protected `Profile` route
- Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- Favorites stored locally for guests and synced to Firestore for logged-in users

Setup

1. Copy `.env` values into `src/firebaseConfig.js` (replace placeholders).
2. From `sample-app/` run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Notes

This is a compact example; customize styles and Firebase config for production.
